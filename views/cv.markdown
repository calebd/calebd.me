  <h3 style="margin-bottom:0;">The MITRE Corporation; May 10-December 11; Software Engineer</h3>
  <p style="margin-left:2em;margin-top:0;">I work on a wide variety of projects at MITRE that involve modern web and mobile technologies. I spend most of my time developing in-house iOS and Ruby on Rails applications that serve many purposes. These include work a social networking iOS application called Handshake, a patient portal healthcare iPad application called hReader, and a Ruby on Rails task management application that integrated with MITRE’s single-sign-on and employee portal. Each of the projects I worked on forced myself and my team members to solve problems that were far outside our comfort zones and allowed us to overcome a lot of really difficult design problems.</p>

  <h3 style="margin-bottom:0;">GUI Cocoa, LLC.; April 09-December 11; Owner & Developer;</h3>
  <p style="margin-left:2em;margin-top:0;">I was still completing my Computer Science degree when I founded GUI Cocoa. My goal from the very beginning was to create applications that were simple, intuitive, and that might solve a problem people didn’t even know they had. I have worked on over a dozen iOS applications, both contracted and on my own. I also maintain several open-source libraries on GitHub (<a href="http://github.com/calebmdavenport">here</a>, <a href="http://github.com/airbrake/airbrake-ios">here</a>, and <a href="http://github.com/guicocoa">here</a>).</p>

  <h3 style="margin-bottom:0;"><a href="http://cnu.edu">Christopher Newport University</a>; Newport News, Virginia - Sep 07-April 11</h3>
  <p style="margin-left:2em;margin-top:0;">I am incredibly passionate about software development. I took an active roll at my university in trying to extend that passion to first- and second-year students who were just getting started in Computer Science. My experience as a tutor helped me grow as a software developer in many ways including the value I hold in always learning new languages and technologies.</p>
